Description: 
    This ONEST software implements the method of assessing the pathologist agreement in reading PD-L1 assays (Reisenbichler et al. (2020 <doi:10.1038/s41379-020-0544-x>)), to determine the minimum number of evaluators needed to estimate agreement involving a large number of raters. Input to the program should be binary(1/0) pathology data, where “0” may stand for negative and “1” for positive. Additional examples were given using the data from Rimm et al. (2017 <doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.0013>).
