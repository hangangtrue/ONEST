## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Used some precomputed results to greatly reduce the time to build the vignettes.

* Made sure that even after this change the package still includes illustrative examples of the use of the user-facing functions.
  
## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

There are no reverse dependencies.
